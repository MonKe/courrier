      <p>Mira made a half-turn to look at Gus with disbelief and contempt. Very soon she had turned around completely and was facing her desk again, thanks to her rotating office chair.</p>
      <p>"Back to work!", she thought, and she reminded herself to say a word in private to the Big Boss about poor loony Gus.</p>
      <p>She did not have the time to write 3 words before a shadow draped over her shoulders and fell onto the piece of Long Long paper. Mira took a long breath and managed to say in a quiet voice:</p>
      <p>"Hello, Gus. Sorry, I have work to finish. Could you please wait by the window?"</p>
      <p>It took an unbelievable amount of concentration not to just turn around and scream at him and I don't know... Bite him? Proof of her heavenly patience could be found in her hands, where the crumpled piece of paper had taken the brunt of her rage. But Gus did not seem to notice his co-worker's mood. Gus did not seem to have any notion of social conventions or proper behavior at the workplace. He just stood there, slightly leaning over Mira's desk like an old tree, and he said again:</p>
      <p>"Miss? I think I found what you're looking for. Your big news. Look!"</p>
      <p>He held in his hand a small, yucky thing. It was all damp and smelly, and was somewhat yellow with brown and dark spots. It looked and smelled rotten. But more than anything what he held in his hand was impossible. It was a banana peel.</p>
      <p class="hr">°°°</p>
      <p>There is a place in Saint-Joan where you will always find a full house. Lights are on from 7 o'clock till 2 in the morning, even on sundays. There is a big old-fashioned window with 9 glass panes, and a vine climbing all around it. Dead vine, of course. There is a small terrace with a couple tables and some old chairs that turned grey overtime. It is a pub named "Toto's Bar" and it houses the man better known as the Laughing Bard.</p>
      <p>He was born a girl and named Clara by the social services that found her on their doorstep a cold day of 1991. Vhery soon Clara was shipped to one foster family after another, every family sending back the child after a few weeks, claimimg that you cloud not touch her without causing a sort of strange jiggling breakdown. Some of them asked for a refound. Clara grew as a lone child, her small bed being kept between two steel cupboards in the filing room of the same social services she had been sent back to so many times. An old man by the name of Josh had taken her in at his office, pitying her. As he did not like touching people, and even less children, he never found out her strange condition. He still kicked her out when she turned 16 to replace her bed with another steel cupboard. It suddenly made filing a lot easier.</p>
      <p>Out the door she went, and she drifted from place to place for a while. She stayed with a group of artists, where she picked her first guitar lessons. The result was very strange and sort of amazing to see: every note she played caused her to have a fit of uncontrolled laughter. She kept on playing anyway. She was very dedicated. Then one day she had a sex change and became Raymond.</p>
      <p>Raymond came back to his hometown Saint-Joan. He found his one and only fan in the person of Ms. Hittfitt, owner of the bar we mentioned earlier. Which brings us to today, another regular day in Toto's where Raymond plays famous songs while his head is wobbling around, and Ms. Hittfitt is drunk again after a half-hour of Raymond's peculiar music and is offering free drinks to anyone praising him. Thus the fame of the Laughing Bard.</p>
      <p>The door opens and beware! Joey Zapato enters a bar again.</p>

      <p>"Where this is going I don't know,
      And if I knew maybe I would not go."<br/>
      (it's a french song)</p>
      <p>It could all start with this: Joey Zapato walks into a bar. His ugly face is twisted into something that could look like a smile, except it does not. Joey is in a bad bad mood. I do not know why, and neither do the old man at the counter or the bartender. No one ever knows "why" with El Zapato.</p>
      <p>He sits next to the old man and asks for a Long Long Cola. No more in stocks 'till tomorrow, says the bartender. A Long Long Whisky, then. Joey gets a small glass filled with the strong stuff. Burns your guts while frying your brain, they say. But Joey doesn't mind.</p>
      <p>We are in the year 2033 and Long Long Grass has taken over the world. At first it only looked like a really annoying and smelly weed. "Let the gardeners do their job", they said. Ten years after, all the other kinds of crops, plants, trees had died out. Only Long Long Grass loomed over the fences, made the cool shade and drank from the rivers through their thirsty roots. As the weed is poison to every living creature but man, the animals all followed soon after into the Great Compost, peace to their skulls. Humanity alone survived - along with the most tenacious weed the planet ever carried. Now in the year 33 no one minds wearing Long Long shirts and eating Long Long burgers, though. The ecologists became extinct when the ecosystem was no more, peace to their skulls too. And that is how Joey can drink this disgusting joke of a whisky without even paying attention.</p>
      <p>The old man next to him is feeling pretty lively. He has a huge beard and a pair of funny little whiskers, and a face that could belong to a really wrinkled newborn. Amazing blue eyes, too. He would be an incredible grandpa if he wasn't just a crackpot and a drunk. That's life, I guess.</p>
      <p>Back to Joey Zapato and his creepy smirk. Without departing from his bad bad mood, he manages to get two shots of the awful liquor down his throat. His breath would kill a fly on the spot, but they all died years ago. El Zapato is now eyeing his glass as if there was something hiding in it. And his twisted mind gives us a peek at something we really do not want to know: the gutter-like thoughts of the man known as El Zapato.</p>
      <p>El Zapato is just thinking about one thing: murder. And bananas.</p>
      <p>I guess that makes two.</p>
      <p class="hr">°°°</p>
      <p>Just one street away from that scene, Mira Leatherman is stuck. She needs news. Bad news. The readers don't buy newspapers to read about happy things. They want crime. They want dirt. How is Mira supposed to get the next News Award with the 34th Apple Feast in Saint-Joan? Sure, Saint-Joan's mayor is a corrupted sleazebag, but he also happens to own the Saturday Gazette. And the suspicious-looking man from this morning, looking around nervously in a Long Long overcoat, really was just Gus, her new coworker.</p>
      <p>"They really fucked up with hiring this time", she thinks. Truely, Gus looks like he has a screw loose. And no sense of style. When asked, he even admitted that he had no previous experience at being a reporter.</p>
      <p>Gus is standing by a window. He still wears the overcoat. He is staring at the street below, has been staring for a while now. He has a faint dumb smile and foggy eyes. It's hard to tell if he is even awake.</p>
      <p>Something must have shaken him up, because he turns around suddenly and says to a frowning Mira:</p>
      <p>"Miss? I think I found just what you need..."</p>
