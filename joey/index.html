      <p>"Where this is going I don't know,
      And if I knew maybe I would not go."<br/>
      (it's a french song)</p>
      <p>It could all start with this: Joey Zapato walks into a bar. His ugly face is twisted into something that could look like a smile, except it does not. Joey is in a bad bad mood. I do not know why, and neither do the old man at the counter or the bartender. No one ever knows "why" with El Zapato.</p>
      <p>He sits next to the old man and asks for a Long Long Cola. No more in stocks 'till tomorrow, says the bartender. A Long Long Whisky, then. Joey gets a small glass filled with the strong stuff. Burns your guts while frying your brain, they say. But Joey doesn't mind.</p>
      <p>We are in the year 2033 and Long Long Grass has taken over the world. At first it only looked like a really annoying and smelly weed. "Let the gardeners do their job", they said. Ten years after, all the other kinds of crops, plants, trees had died out. Only Long Long Grass loomed over the fences, made the cool shade and drank from the rivers through their thirsty roots. As the weed is poison to every living creature but man, the animals all followed soon after into the Great Compost, peace to their skulls. Humanity alone survived - along with the most tenacious weed the planet ever carried. Now in the year 33 no one minds wearing Long Long shirts and eating Long Long burgers, though. The ecologists became extinct when the ecosystem was no more, peace to their skulls too. And that is how Joey can drink this disgusting joke of a whisky without even paying attention.</p>
      <p>The old man next to him is feeling pretty lively. He has a huge beard and a pair of funny little whiskers, and a face that could belong to a really wrinkled newborn. Amazing blue eyes, too. He would be an incredible grandpa if he wasn't just a crackpot and a drunk. That's life, I guess.</p>
      <p>Back to Joey Zapato and his creepy smirk. Without departing from his bad bad mood, he manages to get two shots of the awful liquor down his throat. His breath would kill a fly on the spot, but they all died years ago. El Zapato is now eyeing his glass as if there was something hiding in it. And his twisted mind gives us a peek at something we really do not want to know: the gutter-like thoughts of the man known as El Zapato.</p>
      <p>El Zapato is just thinking about one thing: murder. And bananas.</p>
      <p>I guess that makes two.</p>
      <p class="hr">°°°</p>
      <p>Just one street away from that scene, Mira Leatherman is stuck. She needs news. Bad news. The readers don't buy newspapers to read about happy things. They want crime. They want dirt. How is Mira supposed to get the next News Award with the 34th Apple Feast in Saint-Joan? Sure, Saint-Joan's mayor is a corrupted sleazebag, but he also happens to own the Saturday Gazette. And the suspicious-looking man from this morning, looking around nervously in a Long Long overcoat, really was just Gus, her new coworker.</p>
      <p>"They really fucked up with hiring this time", she thinks. Truely, Gus looks like he has a screw loose. And no sense of style. When asked, he even admitted that he had no previous experience at being a reporter.</p>
      <p>Gus is standing by a window. He still wears the overcoat. He is staring at the street below, has been staring for a while now. He has a faint dumb smile and foggy eyes. It's hard to tell if he is even awake.</p>
      <p>Something must have shaken him up, because he turns around suddenly and says to a frowning Mira:</p>
      <p>"Miss? I think I found just what you need..."</p>
